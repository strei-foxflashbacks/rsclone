5
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.580
winter caretaker and he came up here

6
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.110
with his wife of two little girls who

7
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.880
think about a Tintin from what I've been

8
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.939
told I mean he seemed like a completely

9
00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.510
normal individual but at some point

10
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.310
during the winter he must have suffered

11
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.410
some kind of a complete mental breakdown

12
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.670

13
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.910
