00:00:05.255 --> 00:00:09.593
- My planet Arrakis is so beautiful
when the sun is low.

2
00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:15.807
Rolling over the sands,
you can see spice in the air.

3
00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:22.397
The outsiders ravage our lands
in front of our eyes.

4
00:00:26.777 --> 00:00:27.903
[screaming]

5
00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:33.534
Their cruelty to my people
is all I've known.

6
00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:36.662
[woman chanting]

7
00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:38.872
What's to become of our world?

8
00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:42.209
Paul.
- [gasps]

9
00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:47.464
- My boy. [chuckles]

10
00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:50.509
- Duncan, can I trust you with something?
- Yes. Always. You know that.

11
00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:55.180
- I've been having dreams
about a girl on Arrakis.

12
00:00:55.264 --> 00:00:57.266
I don't know what it means.

13
00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:59.351
- Dreams make good stories,

14
00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:01.979
but everything important happens
when we're awake.

15
00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:04.189
Look at you. Put on some muscle?

16
00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:05.858
- I did?
- No.

17
00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:12.072
- We are House Atreides.
There is no call we do not answer.

18
00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:14.658
There is no faith that we betray.

19
00:01:15.576 --> 00:01:16.702
Smile, Gurney.

20
00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:18.370
- I am smiling.

21
00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:21.373
- The Emperor asks us
to bring peace to Arrakis.

22
00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:23.792
House Atreides accepts.

23
00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:28.839
- I know you.

24
00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:31.049
There's something awakening in my mind.

25
00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:36.805
- You need to face your fears.

26
00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:39.725
- Come with me.

27
00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:44.730
- You need to be ready.

28
00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:48.567
You've never met Harkonnens before.
They're not human. They're brutal.

29
00:01:50.194 --> 00:01:52.404
- The Duke's son, he sees too much.

30
00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:56.950
- This is my Dune. Kill them all.

31
00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:01.914
- God in heaven.

32
00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:06.585
Get everything with guns
off the ground! Go!

33
00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:09.296
- This is an extermination.

34
00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:13.592
They're picking my family off one by one.

35
00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:17.804
- Let's fight like demons.

36
00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:28.565
- Dad, what if I'm not the future
of House Atreides?

37
00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:35.614
- "A great man doesn't seek to lead.
He's called to it."

38
00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:40.869
But if your answer is no...

39
00:02:40.953 --> 00:02:43.497
you'll still be the only thing
I ever needed you to be...

40
00:02:45.332 --> 00:02:46.583
my son.

41
00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:50.921
If anything happens...

42
00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:53.298
will you protect Paul?

43
00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:54.758
- With my life.

44
00:02:59.054 --> 00:03:00.305
- No!

45
00:03:02.641 --> 00:03:04.768
Only together can we stand a chance.

46
00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:12.901
[panting]

47
00:03:12.985 --> 00:03:14.736
- It's time.

48
00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:20.242
[woman chanting]
