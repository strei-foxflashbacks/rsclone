00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.060
I'm Detective Lieutenant Elliot.

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.520
And this is Trooper Wagner.

3
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.540
We just want to ask a few questions.

4
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.280
Now we understand, the night of his demise...

5
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.620
The family had gathered to celebrate your father's eighty-fifth birthday

6
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.640
How was it?

7
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.020
The party?

8
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.640
Pre my dad's death?

9
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.980
Oh, it was great.

10
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.600
Ladies and gentlemen...

11
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.880
I would like to request that you all stay until the investigation is completed.

12
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.640
What?

13
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.880
Can we ask why?

14
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.860
Has something changed?

15
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.400
No.

16
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.800
"No, it hasn't changed", or, "No, we can't ask?"

17
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.060
You think one of this family…

18
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.660
Well, well…

19
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.160
...killed him.

20
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.980
Is that what you're suggesting?

21
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.220
You all love twisting the knife into one another.

22
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.080
Up your ass.

23
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.880
Oh, very nice.

24
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.380
As a matter of fact...

25
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.720
Eat shit.

26
00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:04.739
How's that?

27
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.680
Eat shit.

28
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.820
Eat shit.

29
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.600
Eat shit.

30
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.540
...smug smile...

31
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.540
Definitely eat shit.

32
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.540
You know something.

33
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.360
Spill it.

34
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.880
I suspect foul play.

35
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.640
And I have eliminated no suspects.

36
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.800
It's a twisted web.

37
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.160
And we are not finished untangling it.

38
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.940
Not yet.

39
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.540
What is this?

40
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.180
CSI: KFC?
