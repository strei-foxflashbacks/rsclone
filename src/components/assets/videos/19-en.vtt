00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.830
we used to look up in this

2
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.920
at our place in a star

3
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.529
I just look down and worry about our

4
00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:24.090
place in and Derick go for main engine

5
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.680
start

6
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.539
t-minus 10 we must confront the reality

7
00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.840
that nothing in our solar system can

8
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.239

9
00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.649

start

14
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.530
can you told her you're about to save

15
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.829
the world

16
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.820
and you become a parent three one thing

17
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.099
comes really clear to

18
00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:06.720
and as the don't make sure your children

19
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.979

worlds right within our reach and save

23
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.369
us from extinction here we go

24
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.300
if you just think about your family now

25
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.230
you have to think bigger than that

26
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.330
I am thinking about my family and

27
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.140
millions of other families

28
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.440
maybe we've spent too long

29
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.670
all this our theory

30
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.320
it's the one thing that transcends time

31
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.740
and space

32
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.920
do not go gentle into that good night

33
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.070
old age should burn and rave at close of

34
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.250
day

35
00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.080
against the dying of the light yes you

36
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.110
are

37
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.709
we'll find a way we always have

38
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.810
