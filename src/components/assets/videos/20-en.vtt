1
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.680
The Japanese archipelago.

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.500
Twenty years in the future.

3
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.360
Canine saturation has reached epidemic proportions.

4
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.100
An outbreak of dog flu rips through the city of Megasaki.

5
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.960
Mayor Kobayashi issues emergency orders...

6
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.840
Calling for a hasty quarantine.

7
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.260
Trash Island becomes an exiled colony.

8
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.260
The "Isle of Dogs".

9
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.800
I don't think I can stomach any more of this garbage.

10
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.220
Exactly!

11
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.720
Same here!

12
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.400
Words out of my mouth.

13
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.080
Nobody's giving up around here and don't you forget It.

14
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.000
Ever.

15
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.960
You're "Rex".

16
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.660
You're "King".

17
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.520
You're "Duke".

18
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.520
You're "Boss".

19
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.520
I'm "Chief".

20
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.180
We're a pack of scary, indestructible alpha dogs.

21
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.920
*sneeze*

22
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.380
Atari Kobayashi.

23
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.920
You heroically hijacked a junior Turboprop XJ 750...

24
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.100
Mayday, mayday!

25
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.960
And flew it to the island because of your dog.

26
00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:04.599
Darn it!

27
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.340
I've got a crush on you.

28
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:11.320
Spots!

29
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.880
Spots!

30
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.060
We get the idea.

31
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.200
You're looking for your lost dog, Spots.

32
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.080
Does anybody know him?

33
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.260
Mm-mm. No.

34
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.740
Spots, if he's alive, may very well be living, even at this moment, as a captive prisoner.

35
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.420
Somebody...

36
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.480
Is up to something.

37
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.560
Will you help him?

38
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.340
The little pilot?

39
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.220
Why should I?

40
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.020
Because he's a twelve-year-old boy.

41
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.220
Dogs love those.

42
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.040
We'll find him.

43
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.937
Wherever he is, if he's alive...

44
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.320
We'll find your dog.

45
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.580
It's gonna be a fight!

46
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.040
I wish somebody spoke his language.

47
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.880
Wow!

48
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.700
To the north...

49
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.620
A long, rickety causeway over a noxious sludge marsh leading to a radioactive landfill polluted by toxic chemical garbage.

50
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.960
That's our destination.

51
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.660
Great.
Got it.

52
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.440
Get ready to jump.
