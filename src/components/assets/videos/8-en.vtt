00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.595
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:03.595 --> 00:00:06.588
(body smacking)

3
00:00:06.588 --> 00:00:07.910
(suspenseful music)

4
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.664
- Want a look at a homicide investigation.

5
00:00:10.664 --> 00:00:11.497
- Is that

6
00:00:11.497 --> 00:00:13.510
the man you saw?
- It's him.

7
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.960
- Just tell me her life won't be at risk

8
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.863
if it becomes known she's a witness.

9
00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:21.200
- Any reason you can think

10
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.950
of why Jane may have been targeted?

11
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.490
We'll find her.
- What am I supposed

12
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.323
to do?

13
00:00:28.323 --> 00:00:30.693
Sit around and wait
until I hear she's dead?
